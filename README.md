# Sign-Language-Recognition

Used Resnet50 model in keras which had 50 deep convolutional layers.
Relu and Softmax were used as the activation functions.
Used diï¬€erential error back propagation algorithm for the model. It had 100 input nodes , 2 hidden layers of 64 nodes each and an output layer of 26 nodes (one for each alphabet). Sigmoidal function was used for activation.
